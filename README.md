# SQLProject-MavenFuzzyFactory

<strong>Situation</strong> 
I have been hired as an eCommerce Database Analyst for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an online retailer which has just launched their first product. 

<strong>Objectives</strong>
My role is to help steer the business where I will analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches. 


<strong>Traffic Source Analysis</strong>
Traffic source analysis is about understanding where your customers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic. 

We will be looking at the traffic sources (email, social media, search, direct) and the conversion rates. 

Common Use Cases 
 Analyzing search data and shifting budget towards the engines, campaign or keywords driving the strongest conversion rates. 
 Comparing user behavior patterns across traffic sources to inform creative and messaging strategy. 
 Identifying opportunities to eliminate wasted spend or scale high converting traffic. 

Key Tables -

Note - UTM tracking parameters are used to campaign our paid marketting activities, and stands for urchin tracking module. 

UTM 
 Paid traffic is commonly tagged with UTM parameters, which are appended to URLs and allow us to tie website activity back to specific traffic sources and   campaigns.
